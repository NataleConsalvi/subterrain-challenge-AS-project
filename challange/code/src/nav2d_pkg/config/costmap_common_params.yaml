# These parameters set thresholds on obstacle information put into the costmap.
# The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
# Here, it is set to 5.0 meters, which means that the robot will only update its map with information about obstacles that are within 5 meters of the base.
obstacle_range: 5.0

# The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading.
# Setting it to 5.5 meters as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 5.5 meters away given a sensor reading.
raytrace_range: 5.5

# The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred.
inflation_radius: 0.3
